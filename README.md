# Budget-App

Taking what I learned from the bug tracker, I build a monthly budget calculator where you can input income & expenses. 

In addition, the expenses have a percentage label which shows the % of that expense to the total income. 

You can also delete incomes and expenses, and everything updates in real time. 

To combat a lot of code piling up, I used Model-View-Controller architecture. 

I separated the internal data components into one section, the UI components into another, and the central module controlling them into a third. 

This way, the code was a lot cleaner & the development smoother.
